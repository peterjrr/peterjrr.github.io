I've had an itch to write in public for a long time. In fact, it has featured in my yearly goals since 2015. Every year it got squeezed out by [work](http://pete.studio), travelling, [renovating a house](http://instagram.com/guinearow) or starting a family. But I'm here and I'm quietly making a start.

Why now? Over the last few months I've been inspired by the digital gardens created by [Anne-Laure Le Cunff](https://nesslabs.com/digital-garden-tiddlywiki), [Maggie Appleton](https://maggieappleton.com/garden/) and [Andy Matuschak](https://notes.andymatuschak.org). A digital garden encourages the idea of writing in the open, publishing less polished notes, and tending to them over time. And I like that idea a lot.

It's an antidote to the modern web which seems to be cluttered with click-baity content marketing and 'thought leadership' that regurgitates and recycles the same worn out material. And on the opposite end of the spectrum, there are a handful of writers doing the hard work of helping us understand our world better with truly virtuosic writing. 

But I kind of don’t aspire to being either. This little slice of the internet is primarily for me. Expect it to be honest and a bit rough around the edges as I write about the things I'm learning, doing and thinking. 

It's a way push myself to create more than I consume because [collecting material feels more useful than it usually is](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z8QSUyNdq3CMK79KSnCW7QTR1MPHEFi4Q2LY8) and [writing forces sharper understanding](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z8q1K5a8i95qARkpFwS45qqtQzM8th82TkeUg).

So, here I am — 4 month old baby in my left arm, typing with my right hand, saying, "hello world" 👋
